# jcbl.ws Astro integration

This is an integration for [Astro](https://astro.build), and more specifically my blog. Some things in this package can be reused but the primary use case is for my blog. 

#### Features

- Support for Vercel Image Optimization
- Support for Vercel Edge Middleware

Reach out if you are planning to use this, I really am pushing this up just to tinker with Astro and Vercel.
